I am an entity on the Internet.  I have been here since 1992 in some way shape or form.  Recently I have been lurking around Azure, and now the Amazon, soon to be 10^100.

I was the founder of the Northern California PowerShell User Group in San Francisco.  These days I help organize the [Sacramento Docker](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Sacramento/) User Group.  I have a secret fascination with the Go programming language, and the Kubernetes ecosystem.  I also love Python.
